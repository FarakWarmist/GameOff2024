  - You also came here for an interview right ?
  - That's their strategy to find new sacrifices for the monster here
  - I was so close to escaping before, but the monster caught me, and I am lucky
    I survived
  - I know how to escape this place but I can't really move because of my previous
    escape attempt
  - You must find the keys, to open the locked doors, there you will find fragments
    of the key that opens the door at the bottom, you will know what to do from there,
    good luck
